// via /framework <id>; the active framework's `instruction` is prepended to
// every CLI call as a bracket-style preamble. The bracket format keeps the
// instruction visually separate from the user's actual question and is
// short enough not to dominate the prompt or get echoed noticeably in
// short replies.
//
// Adding a new framework: append to FRAMEWORKS, ensure the id is unique
// and kebab-case, write an instruction that is one paragraph at most, and
// let the user type `/framework <id>` to test it. No code wiring needed
// past this file.
